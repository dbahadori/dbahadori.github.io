## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of .NET Core development, the utilization of Interface types plays a pivotal role in fostering flexibility and extensibility within our applications. By allowing diverse implementations that encapsulate specific logic while adhering to a common contract, represented by the interface, we open doors to a dynamic and adaptable application design.

This article delves into the challenges posed by the need to specify the desired implementation during dependency injection in .NET Core applications. We will navigate through various methods that empower developers to dynamically select and utilize different implementations. The goal is to provide insights and guidance on achieving a flexible Dependency Injection setup, enabling your application to seamlessly adapt to changing requirements and situations.
