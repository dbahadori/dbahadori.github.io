Abstractâ€” One of the most important issues in Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA) environment is continuous development of
services, which is also known as service evolution. In this
paper, we propose a three-dimensional framework for
managing change of services in SOA Environments. The
proposed framework is composed of three dimensions,
including Service, Configuration, and Middleware. The service
dimension as problem domain dimension is related to problems
and issues in service change context. Configuration and
middleware dimensions as solution dimensions are related to
strategies, mechanisms, and patterns to solve the problem that
specified in the service dimension. Also, we specify all activities
that are required to realize each dimension. In solution domain
dimensions, we define meta-models for storing information as
well as a general message preparation pattern base on EIP
patterns in order to prepare the incoming invalid messages for
delivering to their destination.
