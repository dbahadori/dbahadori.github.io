description: 'Abstract—One of the important issues in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment is continuous development of services, which is also known as service evolution. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional framework for managing change of services in SOA Environments. The proposed framework is composed of three dimensions, including Service, Configuration, and Middleware. The service dimension as problem domain dimension is related to problems and issues in service change context. Configuration and middleware dimensions as solution dimensions are related to strategies, mechanisms, and patterns to solve the problem that specified in the service dimension. Also, we specify all activities that are required to realize each dimension. In solution domain dimensions, we define meta-models for storing information as well as a general message preparation pattern base on EIP patterns in order to prepare the incoming invalid messages for delivering to their destination'
