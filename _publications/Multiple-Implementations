excerpt: "One of the primary reasons for utilizing Interface types in our application is to enable diverse implementations that encapsulate specific logic while adhering to a common contract, represented by the interface. This approach enhances the flexibility and extensibility of our application design, enabling it to adapt to varying requirements and situations. However, one challenge we often face is appropriately specifying the desired implementation during dependency injection. This article will explore various methods for dynamically selecting and utilizing different implementations in .NET Core applications through Dependency Injection."
