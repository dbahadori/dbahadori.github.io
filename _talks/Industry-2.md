This was a lecture about opportunities and challenges of industry 4.0 and its core technologies in steel industry that was delivered to domain expertise and public audience at Bandar Abbas branch of Amirkabir University of Technology (more than 50 people). In this lecture, I specifically focused on maturity model of industry 4.0, therefore I presented out comes of my general survey on this subject, in which more than 20 maturity and readiness models, whether industrial or academic, was examined and analyzed.
